Computational Techniques in Biomedical Engineering

This wiki page provides comprehensive details and step-by-step explanations of the Python code used in the project "Practice 1: Computational Techniques in Biomedicine".

The project contains four main computational exercises:

Circle Metrics Calculation
Time Conversion
Number Parity Determination
Leap Year Identification

1. Circle Metrics Calculation
This section of the code calculates the area and perimeter (circumference) of a circle given its radius.

The formulas used for these calculations are:

Area: π * r²
Perimeter (Circumference): 2 * π * r
Here is the Python code used:


2. Time Conversion
The next section of the code converts a given number of days into equivalent hours, minutes, and seconds.

The formulas used are:

Hours: days * 24
Minutes: hours * 60
Seconds: minutes * 60
The Python code is:

3. Number Parity Determination
This part of the code determines if a provided integer number is even or odd.
It is even if it is divisible by 2

4. Leap Year Identification
The last section identifies whether a given year is a leap year or not. A year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400 to be leap years.


These exercises demonstrate basic computational techniques using Python, which is an essential skill for Biomedical Engineering. Remember, mastering these basics will be a stepping stone towards more complex computational problem-solving within the field of biomedicine.

Happy coding!
