# LabCode
Welcome to my repository! I am Esther Ortiz, a 2nd-year student in the Biomedical Engineering program at UPF. You're welcome to reach me via esther.ortiz01@estudiant.upf.edu for any inquiries related to this project.

This project is an essential part of the first practice session for the Computational Techniques in Biomedicine course. The Python-based code in this project provides solutions to a series of basic numerical problems that play a foundational role in biomedical computations:

Circle Metrics Calculation: Calculates the area and perimeter of a circle given its radius.
Time Conversion: Converts a given number of days into equivalent hours, minutes, and seconds.
Number Parity Determination: Determines if a provided integer is even or odd.
Leap Year Identification: Identifies whether a given year is a leap year or not.

Computational techniques are vital to the field of Biomedical Engineering. This involves tasks such as modeling physiological systems, analyzing medical data, or optimizing medical diagnostics. The Python language has gained popularity due to its simplicity and power, and is commonly used in bioinformatics and computational biology.

The limitation lies in bridging the gap between learning programming languages and understanding their practical applications in biomedical engineering. It is common to learn coding syntax and principles without directly seeing how these skills can be applied to real-world biomedical scenarios.

This project aims to provide tangible, practical applications of Python-based computational techniques for typical problems encountered in Biomedical Engineering. Through simple, yet insightful exercises, it endeavors to strengthen the understanding of Python language and its applicability in the field.
