# LabCode
Welcome to my repository! This is a practical project we developed in the first year of our Biomedical Engineering degree, exploring fundamental computational techniques in the context of biomedicine.

Our Python code exercises offer solutions to a series of numerical problems, serving as an excellent tool for learning and practicing basic programming concepts. They aim to build a solid foundation for more complex computational problems in the field of biomedical engineering.


The Python code covers the following concepts:

Calculating the area and perimeter of a circle given its radius: This part prompts the user to input the radius of a circle, and then calculates and prints the area and perimeter of the circle.

Calculating the number of days, minutes, and seconds given a number of days: This part prompts the user to input a number of days, and then calculates and prints the equivalent number of hours, minutes, and seconds.

Determining if a number is even or odd: This part prompts the user to input a number, and then determines and prints whether the number is even or odd.

Determining if a year is a leap year: This part prompts the user to input a year, and then determines and prints whether the year is a leap year or not.

Each of these exercises plays a crucial role in understanding computational logic and building a strong foundation in programming, specifically Python. As biomedical engineers, we often encounter data that need to be analyzed, manipulated, and interpreted. Therefore, developing these basic computational skills will significantly impact our ability to handle more complex problems in the future.
